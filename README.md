## State

State is stored in the S3 bucket `dsekt-terraform-state`. It was created with the following settings:
- region: eu-north-1
- object ownership: acls disabled
- block all public access
- bucket versioning: enable
- default encryption:
  - encryption type: server-side encryption with amazon s3 managed keys (sse-s3)
  - bucket key: enable
- advanced settings: object lock: disable

State locking is done with the DynamoDB table `terraform-lock`. It was created with the following settings:
- partition key: `LockID`, type `String`
- sort key: (blank)
- table settings: customize
- table class: DynamoDB standard
- read/write capacity settings: on-demand
- encryption key management: owned by Amazon DynamoDB

To access this state (and locking), you need valid credentials to do so. These are sourced the same way as the in aws cli, so either environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) or in `~/.aws/credentials`. The required permissions are specified [in the docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3).
